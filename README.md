# truesizeoftheuniverse
A design-led research project exploring how common representations of the solar system distort our understanding of cosmic scale. This site features three interactive experiments — a scrollable distance simulation, an AR planet walk, and a dynamic planetarium — all built to visualize the solar system at true scale, both in size and distance.
