# True Size of the Universe
A design-led research project exploring how common representations of the solar system distort our understanding of cosmic scale. This site features three interactive experiments — a scrollable distance simulation, an AR planet walk, and a dynamic planetarium — all built to visualize the solar system at true scale, both in size and distance.

## Live site

## Contents

- **Scroll:** A vertical website that shows the true distance between celestial bodies — including a light-speed travel counter.
- **AR Walk:** An augmented reality experience where each planet is placed at true distance using your phone.
- **Planetarium:** An interactive simulation of the planets orbiting in real-time, using accurate orbital durations and speeds.
