        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
          <span class="style">True Size of the Universe</span> is a design-led
          research project investigating how visual representations of the solar
          system shape our perception of cosmic scale. From educational posters
          to museum exhibits, the way we illustrate space is riddled with
          distortions: planets are shown far too close together, their sizes
          wildly exaggerated, and the vastness of interplanetary space almost
          entirely erased.
        </p>
        <p>
          These visual shortcuts are often driven by practical constraints —
          page sizes, screen widths, or the limits of human attention. But over
          time, they accumulate into a shared visual language that profoundly
          misrepresents the truth. We grow up with an image of the solar system
          that is neat, compact, and wildly inaccurate. The result is not just a
          warped understanding of space, but a diminished sense of the vastness
          and fragility of our place within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="style">True Size of the Universe</span> responds to this
          problem through three interconnected visual experiments that aim to
          make invisible scales visible:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Scroll</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A data-driven website that invites users to scroll across the solar
          system at true scale. What begins as a familiar web interaction slowly
          turns uncanny: planets shrink to small, nearly invisible dots;
          kilometers of empty space pass beneath the user’s cursor; and
          planetary encounters become rare events. By preserving accurate
          proportions and distances, this experiment transforms a simple act of
          scrolling into a contemplative, time-based journey across astronomical
          space. It challenges the viewer’s expectations of digital interfaces
          and reminds us how vast and sparse the solar system truly is.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>AR Walk</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          An augmented reality experience that overlays the solar system onto
          real-world locations using mobile devices. Each planet is placed at
          its correct size and distance from the Sun, mapped across a walking
          route that stretches over a kilometer. Unlike static diagrams, this
          spatial installation turns the viewer into a participant: you must
          walk the actual distance between planets, revealing how far apart they
          truly are — and how little of that space we typically see. By stepping
          through the solar system at human scale, AR Walk offers a grounded,
          embodied perspective on a cosmic reality we usually experience only in
          abstraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Planetarium</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A modern, interactive take on the traditional planetarium. This
          simulation presents the solar system in motion, with planets orbiting
          the Sun at accurate relative speeds and trajectories. It corrects the
          common misconception that planets move in perfect sync or rest on a
          single orbital plane. Users can speed up or slow down time, rotate the
          system, and observe how motion and distance play out dynamically over
          time. This experiment is not just about scale, but about rhythm —
          revealing how celestial mechanics unfold continuously, in ways that
          static images can never convey.
        </p>

        <p>
          By combining design, code, and critical storytelling, this project
          reframes the solar system not as an abstract diagram, but as a vast
          spatial structure — one that can only be understood through
          experience, distortion-aware design, and a healthy sense of humility.
          It challenges viewers to reconsider the familiar diagrams we've come
          to accept, and to imagine new ways of seeing the cosmos more
          truthfully.

        <h1>About the Designer</h1>
        <p>
          I'm <span class="style">Nore Kerkhofs</span>, a design student with a
          deep interest in how visual systems shape the way we understand the
          world. My work often explores the overlap between science, data, and
          storytelling — especially in areas where complex information is
          simplified or misrepresented.
        </p>
        <p>
          With <span class="style">True Size of the Universe</span>, I wanted to
          challenge the familiar diagrams I grew up seeing in schoolbooks and
          museums. Why are the planets always shown in a neat row? Why is the
          space between them so compressed? This project became a way for me to
          explore those questions, not just through research, but by building
          tools and experiences that offer alternative ways of seeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use design not just to communicate, but to investigate. For me, this
          project is as much about critical thinking as it is about aesthetics —
          and about making space feel as strange, vast, and beautiful as it
          really is.
